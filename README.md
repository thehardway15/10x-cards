## Project Description

FlashAI addresses the time-consuming and monotonous process of manually creating high-quality flashcards. The application provides:

- **AI-Powered Generation**: Convert text (1,000-10,000 characters) into flashcard candidates using advanced AI models
- **Review & Management**: Review, edit, accept, or reject AI-generated flashcard candidates with pagination support
- **Manual Creation**: Traditional CRUD operations for manual flashcard creation and management
- **User Authentication**: Simple email/password-based user accounts without email verification
- **Spaced Repetition Integration**: Export accepted flashcards to existing spaced repetition algorithms
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic for AI API failures
- **Activity Logging**: Comprehensive event logging for KPI measurement

### Success Metrics
- ‚â•75% of AI-generated flashcards accepted by users
- ‚â•75% of all created flashcards originate from AI generation

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22.14.0 (check `.nvmrc` file)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Supabase account and project
- Openrouter.ai API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thehardway15/10x-cards
   cd flashai
   ```

2. **Install Node.js version**
   ```bash
   nvm use
   # or
   nvm install 22.14.0 && nvm use 22.14.0
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
   ```env
   # Supabase Configuration
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   
   # AI Configuration
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
   
   # Application Configuration
   PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:4321
   ```

5. **Database Setup**
   - Set up your Supabase project
   - Create necessary tables for users, flashcards, and logging
   - Configure authentication settings

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:4321`
